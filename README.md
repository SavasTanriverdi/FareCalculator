# FareCalculator

This Java project calculates the total amount payable for a journey based on the distance traveled in kilometers. The project demonstrates how to handle user input, perform arithmetic calculations, and apply conditional logic to calculate the fare based on distance.

## Key Features:
- Take the distance traveled in kilometers as input
- Apply a simple fare formula: total fare = base fare + (cost per km * distance)
- Display the total amount payable for the journey
- Handle different scenarios (e.g., minimum fare, special rates for long distances)

## Usage:
Run the main class and input the distance in kilometers. The program will calculate and display the total amount payable for the journey based on a defined fare structure.

## Technologies Used:
- Java
